# Analyze Light

This repository is used to find the distribution of light samples taken by a Kilobot when in a white, black, and grey environment. 
## Getting Data:

The hex file provided will output 50 light samples for each Kilobot. Each light sample is the average of 50 individual light samples. This output is seen in a serial monitor. For more details on using the serial monitor, see Kilobotics.com. 
I made a .txt file where I first posted "BOT #" and then "White", "Black", or "Grey" depending on what bot and environment my samples were from. 

## Analyzing data:

The .cpp and .hpp files will open a .txt file and output information about each bot specified in the .txt file.
